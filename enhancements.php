        <h1>ENHANCEMENTS</h1>
        <p class="enhancement"><strong>1. Letter Spacing </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Location Used: <a href="index.php">HOME page</a> 
        <br>
        <br>Referrence website : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_letter-spacing.asp">w3schools.com</a> 
        <br>
        <br> Explanation : Letter Spacing allowed welcoming message to the website more popped up and asthetic. Without the letter 
        spacing , the homepage seemed very blant. The code used was 'letter-spacing: 3px;' which is used in the class= moto attribute.
        this spaced out the letters in words and makes it look more appealing to the eyes. 
        </p>
        <p class="enhancement"><strong>2. CSS transition Property </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Location Used: <a href="product.php">BIKE FOR SALE page in images</a> 
        <br>
        <br>Referrence website : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition.asp">w3schools.com</a> 
        <br>
        <br> Explanation : This property allows the product images be more attractive. It enlarges the image in less than a second and shows the process of it.
        This enhancement makes the images in product make more exquisite and appealing.
        </p>
        <p class="enhancement"><strong>3. HTML Target attribute </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Location Used: <a href="index.php">Home page in navigation</a> 
        <br>
        <br>Referrence website : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp">w3schools.com</a> 
        <br>
        <br> Explanation : This attribute allows user to open the linked html files in another tab in their browser from the homepage. The reason I have only 
        applied this attribute to the menu list in homepage is that it increases user interactivity. Most users prefer to open the linked html files 
        in the homepage of a website to be opened in another tab but this should not be the case for the other html files. Only the homepage should allow such 
        feature. 
        </p>
        <p class="enhancement"><strong>4. CSS Responsive Design  </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Location Used: <a href="index.php">Home page, </a><a href="about.php">About page </a> 
        <br>
        <br>Referrence : lab04 tasks 
        <br>
        <br> Explanation : My website is very much responsive for display dimensions over 650 x 1024. In this extra css file , I have made 
        the homepage as well as the about page more responsive to such display dimensions.
