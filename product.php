        <h3>Ducati Panigale V4 S</h3>
        <p>The 2018 Ducati Panigale V4 S is a premium sports bike which builds on the base V4 
            with a lightweight Lithium battery, forged wheels and Ohlins electronic suspension.
            Ducati bought over a few bits from the V4 R. Specifically the wings and cooling gills,
            the lighter front frame and the Evo 2 traction control. They also tweaked the suspension
            to be a tiny bit taller, improved the quickshifter and revised the engine mapping to make 
            the first few gears smoother. It has fantastic electronic suspension alongside with sheer acceleration.
            In addition to this, its wonderful sound and cornering to is never left unnoticed.

        <h3> Kawasaki Ninja H2 </h3>
        <p>
            The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is a legendary dedicated sports bike and 
            is powered by a liquid cooled 998 cc inline four engine with a supercharger, 
            producing 197.4 bhp at 11,000 rpm and maximum torque at 10,500 rpm. The ram-air 
            effect adds another 10 bhp. Force is confined from around 10,000 rpm despite the
             fact that the redline shows at 14,000 rpm on the scramble, though the track just H2R 
             fabricates power as far as possible and has wings. The 5-talked 17" wheels take a 120/70 
             tire at the front and monstrous 200/55 at the back. Frill incorporate casing sliders (£174),
              20 mm handlebar risers (£185), 80° tire warmers, 50°/80°/100° evo tire warmers (£476) and 
              front/back enclosure stands.
